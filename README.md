# Features
**Quick scaffolding**

Create components, connected components, modules - and their tests - right from the CLI!

**Instant feedback**

Enjoy the best DX (Developer eXperience) and code your app at the speed of thought!
Your saved changes to the CSS and TypeScript are reflected instantaneously without refreshing the page.
Preserve application state even when you update something in the underlying code!

**SEO** (with [vue-meta](https://github.com/declandewet/vue-meta))

We support SEO (document head tags management) and server-side-rendering for search engines
that support indexing of JavaScript content. (eg. Google)

**Progressive-Web-App**

Offline-first support with service-workers and a lighthouse score as high as possible (for me - 90+).

**Enterprise ready**

Common style guide, TypeScript and the best test setup: Automatically guarantee code quality and non-breaking changes.

**Animations** (with [anime.js](http://animejs.com/))

A stable animations set up already included.

**Components**

A flexible component library that'll be extended over time.

**Storybook**

Storybook for Vue is a UI development environment for UI components. It allows interactive development, testing and sharing of UI components in various property states.

It runs outside of your app. So you can develop UI components in isolation without worrying about app specific dependencies and requirements.
Run `npm run storybook`. The server runs on port `6006`.

**Industry-standard i18n internationalization support**

Scalable apps need to support multiple languages, easily add and support multiple languages with [vue-i18n](https://github.com/kazupon/vue-i18n).

**Predictable state management**

Centralized State Management with [vuex](https://github.com/vuejs/vuex).

**Routing with data prefetching**

Server-side-rendering of prefetched data and transferring state from server to client.
