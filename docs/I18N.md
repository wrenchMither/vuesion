# i18n (WIP)


### extract messages

To extract all your i18n IDs run `npm run extract-i18n-messages`.
This will generate the languages JSON files in the folder `./i18n`

To add new language files add a new entry to the `package.json -> config."supported-languages"` attribute.

This script also enables you to define default messages with a magic comment:

`$t('App.nav.components' /*Components*/)`,
this will add `'Components'` as default value to all `'App.nav.components'` keys,
but will keep previously added values.
